## Story
As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

## Expected Behaviour
1. Search form is displayed on the landing page for user to search a City of their choice
2. Weather for that current day is displayed for the chosen city. Displaying the following:
- City & Date 
- Icon representing the current weather 
- Temperature
- Wind
- Humidity
3. A 5-day forecast for the chosen city is also displayed including the same information as above
4. Searched cities are saved to local storage and displayed as buttons for easy accessibility when the user returns to the page
